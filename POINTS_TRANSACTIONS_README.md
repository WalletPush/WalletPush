## 🚧 In Progress / Blocked

### Points & Transactions Page 🚧
- **File**: `src/app/business/points-transactions/page.tsx`
- **Status**: Created but has dependency issues
- **Problem**: Missing UI components causing compilation errors

## ❌ Missing Dependencies

### Required NPM Packages
```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-tabs @radix-ui/react-select date-fns
```

### Missing UI Components
1. **Tabs Component**: `src/components/ui/tabs.tsx`
   - Created but needs `@radix-ui/react-tabs` dependency
2. **Select Component**: `src/components/ui/select.tsx`
   - Not created yet, needs `@radix-ui/react-select` dependency

## 🎯 Next Steps (In Order)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
cd /Users/davidsambor/Desktop/WalletPush
npm install @radix-ui/react-tabs @radix-ui/react-select date-fns
```

### Step 2: Create Missing UI Components

#### A. Create Select Component
**File**: `src/components/ui/select.tsx`
```typescript
// Need to create shadcn/ui style Select component
// Based on @radix-ui/react-select
```

#### B. Verify Tabs Component
**File**: `src/components/ui/tabs.tsx` (already created)
- Should work once `@radix-ui/react-tabs` is installed

### Step 3: Test Points & Transactions Page
- Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/business/points-transactions`
- Verify both tabs load correctly:
  - **Requests Tab**: Shows pending action requests with approve/decline buttons
  - **Ledger Tab**: Shows completed transactions from `customer_events`

### Step 4: Integration Testing
1. **Member Side**: Submit action requests via member dashboard
2. **Business Side**: Approve/decline requests in Points & Transactions page
3. **Verify**: Approved requests create entries in customer_events ledger
4. **Verify**: Balance updates and side effects trigger correctly

## 📋 Feature Specifications

### Points & Transactions Page Design

#### Tab 1: Requests (Action Queue)
- **Data Source**: `action_requests` table
- **Features**:
  - Filter by status (pending, approved, declined)
  - Filter by action type (check_in, earn_points, redeem_offer, etc.)
  - Search by customer name/email
  - Approve/Decline buttons for pending requests
  - Real-time status updates
  - Risk score display
  - Policy applied information

#### Tab 2: Ledger (Source of Truth)
- **Data Source**: `customer_events` table
- **Features**:
  - All approved transactions that hit the ledger
  - Filter by action type and date range
  - Search by customer
  - Export functionality
  - Amount deltas display (points, stored value)
  - Metadata and audit trail
  - Links back to original action requests

### Action Request Flow
1. **Member submits action** → `action_requests` (status: pending)
2. **Auto-approval check** → If passes, create `customer_events` + update status
3. **Manual approval** → Staff reviews in Points & Transactions page
4. **Approval** → Create `customer_events` + update balances + trigger side effects
5. **Decline** → Update status with reason

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Mental Model
- **action_requests** = The queue (intent, pending approval)
- **customer_events** = The ledger (truth, what actually happened)
- **Points & Transactions page** = Two views of the same flow

### Data Flow
```
Member Action → action_requests → (approval) → customer_events → side effects
                     ↓                              ↓
              Requests Tab                    Ledger Tab
```

### Side Effects (on approval)
1. Update customer balances (`customers` table)
2. Create offer claims if redeeming
3. Trigger pass updates (Apple/Google Wallet)
4. Send notifications
5. Run automations/webhooks

## 🐛 Known Issues
- Cursor tool freezing issues preventing smooth development
- Need to install dependencies manually via terminal
- Select component needs to be created

## 🚀 Success Criteria
- [x] Member can submit action requests
- [x] API handles requests with proper validation
- [ ] Business staff can view pending requests
- [ ] Business staff can approve/decline requests
- [ ] Approved requests create ledger entries
- [ ] Ledger tab shows complete transaction history
- [ ] Filters and search work correctly
- [ ] Real-time updates after approval/decline
